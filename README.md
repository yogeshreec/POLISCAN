# 📊 POLISCAN – Election Contributions Analytics  
💡 *Turning U.S. political donation data into insights, trends, and transparency.*

---

## 📌 Overview 

Poliscan is an end-to-end big data analytics platform that leverages the publicly available OpenFEC (Federal Election Commission) datasets to uncover insights from U.S. political donation patterns. Built using a scalable AWS-based data pipeline architecture, the system enables political analysts, regulatory agencies, journalists, and the public to monitor political financing activities and detect anomalies with ease.

Our platform supports transparent, data-driven decisions in the electoral landscape by visualizing financial trends, flagging suspicious activities, and simplifying access to campaign finance data.

## 🗂 Datasets Used  

📂 **Primary Sources:**  
- 🗃️ [Individual Contributions Dataset](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/contributions-individuals-file-description/) — All donations made by individuals  
- 🗃️ [Committee Master](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/committee-master-file-description/) — Committees receiving contributions  
- 🗃️ [Candidate Master](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/candidate-master-file-description/) — Candidate details, elections, and party affiliation

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- [x] **Clean & structure** raw OpenFEC datasets (~40 GB) for analysis  
- [x] Identify **key features** — donation amounts, donor demographics, transaction types  
- [x] Detect **unusual or suspicious donations** using rule-based validation checks  
- [x] Create **interactive dashboards** to visualize donation patterns and anomalies  


## 🏛 Architecture

1. **Bronze Layer** – Stores raw OpenFEC data for reference  
2. **Silver Layer** – Data cleaning, standardization, and enrichment (AWS Glue + Amazon EMR)  
3. **Gold Layer** – Optimized, query-ready data for analytics (Amazon Athena + Power BI)
